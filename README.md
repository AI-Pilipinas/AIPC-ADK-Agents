# 🤖 AI Pilipinas Cebu — Agent Collection

Welcome to the **AI Pilipinas Cebu Agent Collection** — a community-driven repository where we build, share, and collaborate on AI agents to solve real-world problems.

Whether you're exploring agents with the [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://github.com/google/agent-development-kit), building something cool with LangChain, or just experimenting with your own ideas — this is the place for you.  

> 🌟 Our goal is to **empower Filipinos** to explore agentic AI and contribute to a shared ecosystem of smart, useful, and innovative agents.
